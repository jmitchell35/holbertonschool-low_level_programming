This project is our first C project of the year. 

The aim is to familiarize us with the basics of C, the Betty coding style, as well as to review some bash commands we have seen previsouly and deepen their usage.

We are also expected to understand the global process of compiling, as well as all of its subprocesses.

All of this is achieved by writing bash scripts decomposing the process of compiling with gcc.
